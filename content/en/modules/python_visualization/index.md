## Tutorial

 * 1. Download the jupyter notebook (save raw version from Github), or start a new jupyter notebook 
 * 2. Watch the video and test the code yourself

## Exercice

For example purposes, we will make use of a phenotypic dataset from the ABIDE II consortium. This amazing international multi-site dataset contains data from individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and healthy controls. We will use a version of the phenotypic data [data dowload](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_II.html) from a single site (Kennedy Krieger Institute). Thus please download the dataset from the linked resource providing your NITRC credentials.

Let's read this from the Web using Pandas. We explicitly specify that missing values are noted in the dataset as 'n/a'.

     # import librairies
     %matplotlib inline
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     import numpy as np
     import pandas as pd

 * Create a figure with a single axes and replot the second scatterplot to group by sex instead of dx_group.
         
         Set the figure size to a ratio of 8 (wide) x 5 (height)
         Use the colors red and gray
         Set the opacity of the points to 0.5
         Label the axes
         Add a legend
 *
Using the same dataset
