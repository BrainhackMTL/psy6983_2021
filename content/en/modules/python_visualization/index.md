## Resources
This module was presented by Jacob Vogel during the QLSC 612 course in 2020, the slides are available [here](https://github.com/neurodatascience/course-materials-2020/blob/master/lectures/14-may/01-data-visualization/python_visualization_for_data.ipynb).

## Tutorial

 * Download the jupyter notebook (save raw version from Github), or start a new jupyter notebook 
 * Watch the video and  run the cells in the notebook

## Exercice

For this next part, we will refer to the following [notebook](https://github.com/neurodatascience/course-materials-2020/blob/master/lectures/14-may/01-data-visualization/python_visualization_intro.ipynb)

For example purposes, we will make use of a phenotypic dataset from the ABIDE II consortium. This amazing international multi-site dataset contains data from individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and healthy controls. We will use a version of the phenotypic  [data](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_II.html) from a single site (Kennedy Krieger Institute). Thus please download the dataset from the linked resource providing your NITRC credentials. If you don't have one, you can create an account.

1. **Read through the notebook running all the cells**
2. **Complete the exercises in the notebook**

**Exercise 1** Create a figure with a single axes and replot the second scatterplot to group by sex instead of dx_group.

       Set the figure size to a ratio of 8 (wide) x 5 (height)
       Use the colors red and gray
       Set the opacity of the points to 0.5
       Label the axes
       Add a legend
     
**Exercise 2** Using a pairwise plot, compare the distributions of age, viq, and piq with respect to dx_group.

        Set a palette
        Set style to ticks
        Set context to paper
        Suppress the dx_group variable from being on the plot
        
**Exercise 3** Using a violin plot separate out viq as a function of sex and dx_group.

        Different dx_group should be on each half of each violin
        The x-axis should reflect the different sex categories.
