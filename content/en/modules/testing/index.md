The [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) library is the go-to way to implement unit tests in python. If you intend to do unit testing in python, you should get familiar with this tool; either through the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/contents.html#toc), with a tutorial such as [this one](https://www.guru99.com/pytest-tutorial.html) or watching [this PyConDE keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMuSn9cofbI).
