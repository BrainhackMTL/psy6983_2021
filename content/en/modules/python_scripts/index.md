## Information

The estimated time to complete this training module is 2h.

The prerequisites to take this module are:
 * the [installation](/modules/installation) module.

Contact François Paugam if you have questions on this module, or if you want to check that you completed successfully all the exercises.

## Resources
This module was presented by [Greg Kiar](https://github.com/gkiar) during the QLSC 612 course in 2020, with [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/edit#slide=id.g362da58057_0_1) from Joel Grus' talk at JupyterCon 2018.

## Exercise

 * In a new directory, create a file `useful_functions.py`.
 * In this file, implement a function `change_case` that takes as input a string and that returns this string with the first character in upper case and the rest in lower case (e.g. `"myInputString"` -> `"Myinputstring"`). Hint : use the `.upper()` and `.lower()` methods of the string type.
 * In the same file, implement an other function `get_words` that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. The list should contain the words in the input string (e.g. `"My input string"` -> `["My", "input", "string"]`). Hint : use the `.split()` method.
 * In the same file, implement a third function `join_words` that does the reverse as the `get_words` function, i.e. taking a list of word and returning one string with all the words (e.g. `["My", "input", "string"]` -> `"My input string"`).
 * Create a new file `main_script.py`. In this file use the Argparse library introduced in the video so that a user can call it with two arguments : a `--text` argument containing a string and a `--case` argument which can take the value "upper", "lower" or "mixed". The script should print the text argument with the case asked (mixed being the one generated by the `change_case` function). For example :
 ```
 ./main_script --text "My awesome text." --case mixed
 My Awesome Text.

 ./main_script --text "My awesome text." --case upper
 MY AWESOME TEXT.
 ```
 Hint : import and use the functions from the `useful_functions.py` file. Don't forget the `if __name__ == "__main__"` even though in this example it won't make a difference, it is never too early to get used to good practices.
 * Follow up with François Paugam to validate you completed the exercise correctly.

If you are curious to learn more advanced capabilities for the Argparse library, you can check this [Argparse tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html).

To learn more about python in general, you can check the [tutorials of the official python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and choose the topic you want to learn. I also recommend the [porgramiz tutorials](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) which have nice videos. Finally for even nicer and fancier videos there is the excellent [python programming playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-) from the youtube channel Socratica.
