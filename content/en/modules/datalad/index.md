## Information

The estimated time to complete this training module is 3h.

The prerequisites to take this module are:
 * the [installation](/modules/installation) module.
 * the [introduction to the terminal](/modules/introduction_to_terminal) module.
 * the [introduction to git and github](/modules/git_github) module can help, but not required.
 * the [project management](/modules/project_management) module is recommended, but not required.

Contact Pierre Bellec if you have questions on this module, or if you want to check that you completed successfully all the exercises.

## Resources
This module was presented by [Adina Wagner](https://twitter.com/AdinaKrik) during the HBM brainhack in 2020.

The material of the tutorial is available [here](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/code_from_chapters/OHBM.html).

The video of her presentation is available below:

## Exercise
 * Follow along the tutorial with Adina. You can copy paste the commands from the datalad handbook section linked above, while following the video.
   * **Warning**: the url for one of the books in the tutorial (`byte-of-python.pdf`) is broken, so the pdf is unreadable. This does not impact the tutorial, but just don't be surprised if that document does not open. Also it shows how important it is to create persistent URLs when you release material, such as those offered on platforms like `zenodo`, `osf` or `figshare`.
   * **warning 2** to follow the tutorial you may need to install new command line tools, such as `tree`.
 * Check with Pierre Bellec to validate that the history of your datalad repository includes all the steps of the tutorial.
 * :tada: :tada: :tada: you completed this training module! :tada: :tada: :tada:

## More resources
