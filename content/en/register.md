The BrainHack School is open in priority to students registered at one of the
four partner institutions. However, **a quota of participants will be selected
from outside of these universities, and possibly from outside of Canada**. The
selection of students is based on the following criteria:

- ensuring a good diversity and complementarity of backgrounds across
  participants,
- assessing whether participants will benefit from attending the school,
- a lottery, if necessary.

**Please apply for brainhack school with the form below and wait for
confirmation of acceptance before registering through your university portal**.
There is a limited number of seats and priority will be given to students who
take the course for credits. Check the information below for eligibility
criteria.
